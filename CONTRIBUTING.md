## üß© New components 

**Target audience**: developers who want to add a new component to the library, usually after creating a new component in `oeb-visualizations`.

**How to add a new component to the site**:
The different components are showcased in the main page (`pages/index.vue`), in separate cards. To add a new card for a new library component, you need to:
- Create a branch from `main` with the name of the new component.
- Create the main content of the new card as a separate component in the `components` folder (let's call this the "content component"). You put there whatever you consider necessary to showcase the new library component.
- Import the "content component" in the `index.vue` file.
- Add the details of the new card in the `components` array in the `index.vue` file. The details are:
    - `title`: title of the card (usually the name of the component or a variation of it).
    - `component`: the "content component" you imported.
    - `documentationLink` (optional): link to the documentation of the component.
- Create a pull request to merge the new branch into `main`.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Other modifications
**Target audience**: developers who want to make any other modification to the site. Inclludes documentation, styles, layout, etc. 

**How to make any other modification**:
- Create a branch from `main` with the name of the modification.
- Make the changes you consider necessary.
- Create a pull request to merge the new branch into `main`. 

If the changes are substantial, you may want/need to discuss them with the rest of the team. In such case, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/inab/oeb-visualizations-demo/issues/new) in this repository.

## üöÄ Deployment
